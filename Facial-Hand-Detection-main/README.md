# Facial and Hand Movement Detection

This project showcases integrating computer vision techniques to detect and track facial expressions and hand gestures in real-time. Leveraging the MediaPipe library in Python, this project offers a practical demonstration of how advanced image processing algorithms can be applied to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and immersive user experiences.

## Key Features

- Utilization of MediaPipe's Face Mesh module to accurately detect and track facial landmarks like eyes, nose, and mouth, enabling detailed facial expression analysis.
- Employment of the Hand module to recognize hand gestures such as waving and pointing.
- Real-time visualization of facial and hand landmarks overlaid on the webcam video feed, providing instant feedback.
- Facilitation of natural user interaction with computers and devices through analysis of these landmarks, enabling gesture-based navigation, gaming, and augmented reality experiences.

## Applications

- Human-Computer Interaction
- Healthcare
- Security
- Market Research
